**Data Flow Explanation**

The dataset was first obtained from Kaggle and downloaded as CSV through Excel. The raw files were then uploaded to AWS RDS and stored in a MySQL database. All data cleaning, modelling, and analysis were performed directly through MySQL queries on the cloud-hosted data. Finally, the same RDS database was connected to Power BI using the MySQL connector to build dashboards and visual insights. This represents the full end-to-end pipeline used in the project.
