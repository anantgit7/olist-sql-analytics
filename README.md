Project Overview

The Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset is a real-world marketplace dataset from Brazil containing orders, customers, sellers, products, payments, reviews, and delivery information.
This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project built using Kaggle dataset, AWS RDS, MySQL, and Power BI.

Data was cleaned and modeled into a Star Schema (facts & dimensions) and hosted on AWS RDS for analysis. The project includes:

⦁	Customer retention & churn analysis

⦁	Seller performance segmentation

⦁	Cohort trends

⦁	Category revenue insights

⦁	Power BI dashboards

It demonstrates a complete pipeline:

Raw data → SQL analytics → Power BI visuals → Business insights

This structure makes it recruiter-friendly and portfolio-ready.

**Each folder includes a dedicated README that provides a clear explanation of its contents, making it easy to understand the work without needing to go through all the code.**
