Project Overview

The Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset is a real-world marketplace dataset from Brazil containing orders, customers, sellers, products, payments, reviews, and delivery information.
This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics project built using Kaggle dataset, AWS RDS, MySQL, and Power BI.
Data was cleaned and modeled into a complete Star Schema (facts & dimensions) and hosted on AWS RDS for analysis.
The project includes customer retention, churn analysis, seller performance, cohort trends, category revenue insights, and dashboards.
It demonstrates a full pipeline from raw data → SQL analytics → Power BI visuals → business insights, suitable for recruiters and portfolio review.
